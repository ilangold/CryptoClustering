# Unsupervised Clustering
## Module 19 Challenge

This repository reads a CSV file of Crypto token price percent-change data into a dataframe and uses scaling and PCA to cluster the data points using K means after completion of elbow curves to select ideal cluster number.

The source data is saved in the Resources folder ("crypto_market_data.csv") and the entire analysis runs in the "Crypto_Clustering" jupyter notebook running python.
